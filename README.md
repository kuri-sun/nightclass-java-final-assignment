Problem-1 (Description)
</summary>

< desicription >

MyCompanyis in the business of building castles. Now, we also believe in quality aesthetics, so we only want to build castles in two types of places:

 a. Peaks
 b. Valleys 

Let‚Äôs say you have an array of integers that describes a stretch of land, where each integer represents the current height of the land. Can you write a function that reads that array and returns the number of castles that MyCompanyshould build on that stretch of land?

Problem-2
</summary>

MyCompanydoes love transforming people, lives, teams, companies. And there‚Äôs no better representation of transformation than Hasbro‚Äôs Transformers, the classic television series featuring heroic Autobotsraging their battle to destroy the evil forces of the Deceptions. 

Please watch this video:

Implement a Java project to do the following:

The Transformers are at war and youare in charge of settling the score! You‚Äôre to evaluate who wins a fight between the Autobotsand the Decepticons. Here are the rules. 

  ‚Ä¢Each Transformer has the following criteria on their tech spec (see http://www.ntfa.net/ntfa/techspecs/index.php?cat=Gen1&group=DeceptPZ&char=Predaking for an example): 

  oStrength
  oIntelligence
  oSpeed
  oEndurance
  oRank
  oCourage
  oFirepower
  oSkill

All of these criteria are ranked from 1 to 10.

  ‚Ä¢The ‚Äúoverall rating‚Äù of a Transformer is the following formula: 

    o(Strength + Intelligence + Speed + Endurance + Firepower)

  ‚Ä¢Each Transformer must either be an Autobot or a Deception. 
  
Your program should take input that describes a group of Transformers and based on that group displays: (See an example next page)

  a.The number of battles 
  b.The winning team 
  c.The surviving members of the losing teamThe basic rules of the battle are: 
  
    ‚Ä¢The teams should be sorted by rank and faced off one on one against each other in order to determine a victor, the loser is eliminated 

    ‚Ä¢A battle between opponents uses the following rules: 
      
      oIf any fighter is down 4 or more points of courage and 3 or more points of strength compared to their opponent, the opponent automatically wins the face-off regardless of overall rating (opponent has ran away)
      
      oOtherwise, if one of the fighters is 3 or more points of skill above theiropponent, they win the fight regardless of overall rating 
      
      oThe winner is the Transformer with the highest overall rating 
      
      oIn the event of a tie, both Transformers are considered destroyed
      
      oAny Transformers who don‚Äôt have a fight are skipped (i.e. if it‚Äôs ateam of 2 vs. a team of 1, there‚Äôs only going to be one battle).
      
      oThe team who eliminated the largest number of the opposing team is the winner.

Special rules: 
  ‚Ä¢Any Transformer named Optimus Prime or Predakingwins his fight automatically regardless of any other criteria 
  
  ‚Ä¢In the event either of the above face each other (or a duplicate of each other), the game immediately ends with all competitors destroyed
